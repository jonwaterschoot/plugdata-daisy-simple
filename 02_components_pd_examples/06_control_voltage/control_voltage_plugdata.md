From Daisy forum, an [answer by Takumi Ogata](https://forum.electro-smith.com/t/is-there-a-resource-for-how-to-use-json-pin-names-when-using-pd2dsy/4005/6):

## Name

### Control Voltage - CV


**CV/gate (an abbreviation of control voltage/gate)** is an analog method of controlling synthesizers, drum machines, and similar equipment with external sequencers. The control voltage typically controls pitch and the gate signal controls note on-off.

> The Daisy Seed outputs 0.0V-3.3V out of its DAC outputs. And on boards like the Daisy Patch, that signal is amplified to 0.0V-5.0V.


## function - what can it do

Unlike the midi format, CV is a protocol of communicating with variable Voltages. It is an analog way of sending or receiving a value.

It is often used on desktop synths to allow communicating with other synths or Eurorack systems.

## what it looks like

Generally CV is transferred via a TS, mono patch cable, in the 3.5mm jack format.

## Pins

Eurorack and CV signals vary in the range they operate in, on some devices you can setup what this range is. Typical ranges are â€“5V to 5V, 0V to 5V, 0V to 10V ...

Also worth noting that, even if you decided to use pin D20 as analog A5, it doesnâ€™t care if youâ€™re using an analog component like potentiometer or digital component like a switch as long as the voltage coming in is 0.0V to 3.3V range.

ADC: all Analog labeled pins: D15 to D25 and D28
DAC OUT: Only pins D22 and D23

If you need more in/out-puts you'll need to add some extra circuitry: e.g. for arduino / cpp Takumi Ogata posted this: [Letâ€™s Add 4+ More DACs/CVs with Quad DAC! (Also, I2C tips!)](https://forum.electro-smith.com/t/lets-add-4-more-dacs-cvs-with-quad-dac-also-i2c-tips/3428)

## Components json

This json is set up for a Synthux Simple Fix pcb. There are two pots and two mono jacks installed on this board.
Note how cv_1 is also setup like a potentiometer with `"component": "AnalogControl"`

```json
{
   "name": "SimpleFix",
   "som": "seed",
   "audio": {
     "channels": 2
   },

    "components": {
