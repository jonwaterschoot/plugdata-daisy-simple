# This is a work in progress

{: .highlight}
> This website is not completed, at all ...

The main goal was to provide some working examples of Plugdata code that works with components like knobs and LEDs connected to the Daisy seed.

Ironically, thus far only the pages on setting up are quasi ready. ðŸ™ˆ

## Why I made this

The origin of this website comes from joining [Synthux Academy](https://www.synthux.academy/) and learning about the option to use Plugdata to program Daisy seed.

As I was taking notes when I was trying to get up and running in Plugdata with a touch sensor + the Daisy seed, I started thinking about a repository with some basic examples.

Right at the time as I was doing this, Synthux brought out the Simple Touch PCB, using the sensor I already had. When they then also launched the Synthmas challenge, I just had to join.

As I got praise for the project and the documentation I made, I felt even more motivated to start this site.

This was my submission:
[Soundscpr_alpha:](https://jonwtr.notion.site/Plugdata-and-daisy-seed-mpr121-touch-sensor-41be6a24dc0b4dc4bdd2fffbe4763dee) stereo audio input - drone synth - stereo delay - fx patch, made in Plugdata.

## From markdown to Github Pages

It's built with markdown and gets published to a Github Pages website via the tool just-the-docs.

This also has been a learning process, but has brought me some new knowledge on the Github workflow with vscode.

The goal is to give a starters guide for noobs wanting to learn how to connect and setup your own hardware with the software Plugdata.

The Plugdata approach has the capacity to be a bit more user friendly than going for the full-on coding method with e.g. Arduino or C++. But also has the potential to be your goto for larger projects.

These are some of the topics I'd like to tackle on this site:

Setting up Plugdata
* What is Pure Data, what is Plugdata
* Installation
* Plugdata to Daisy

* Basic insight in the handling of signal flow, memory and cpu (TODO)

Library of examples showing the usage of basis components:
* potentiometer and faders
* momentary pushbutton = switches
* Toggle /switch

More 'advanced' parts:
* LED
* Encoder
* Midi
* Sensors
* CV
* Screens

Feel free to contact me @jonwtr on the Discord servers of Synthux, Plugdata or Daisy

Find my contact info via the my website, [www.jonwtr.be](https://www.jonwtr.be) the one I was supposed to set up instead of this one ...
