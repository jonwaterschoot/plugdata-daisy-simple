From Daisy forum, an [answer by Takumi Ogata](https://forum.electro-smith.com/t/is-there-a-resource-for-how-to-use-json-pin-names-when-using-pd2dsy/4005/6):

> The Daisy Seed outputs 0.0V-3.3V out of its DAC outputs. And on boards like the Daisy Patch, that signal is amplified to 0.0V-5.0V.

> The Daisy (unlike Arduino) has GPIO pins. So pin D20 can be analog input or even digital output. Also worth noting that, even if you decided to use pin D20 as analog A5, it doesnâ€™t care if youâ€™re using an analog component like potentiometer or digital component like a switch as long as the voltage coming in is 0.0V to 3.3V range.

For pd2dsy and Oopsy, I havenâ€™t looked too deep into it.

## Name

### Control Voltage - CV


**CV/gate (an abbreviation of control voltage/gate)** is an analog method of controlling synthesizers, drum machines, and similar equipment with external sequencers. The control voltage typically controls pitch and the gate signal controls note on-off.

> The Daisy Seed outputs 0.0V-3.3V out of its DAC outputs. And on boards like the Daisy Patch, that signal is amplified to 0.0V-5.0V.


## function - what can it do

Unlike the midi format, CV is a protocol of communicating with variable Voltages. It is an analog way of sending or receiving a value.

It is often used on desktop synths to allow communicating with other synths or Eurorack systems.

## what it looks like

Generally CV is transferred via a TS, mono patch cable, in the 3.5mm jack format.

## Pins

Eurorack and CV signals vary in the range they operate in, on some devices you can setup what this range is. Typical ranges are â€“5 V to 5 V, 0 V to 5 V, 0 V to 10 V ...

ADC: all Analog labeled pins: D15 to D25 and D28
DAC OUT: Only pins D22 and D23
