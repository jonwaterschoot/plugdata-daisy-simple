# This is a work in progress

This page is the first setup for creating an environment where I can draft the first version of this guide idea.

The origin of this website comes from joining Synthux Academy and learning about the option to use Plugdata to program Daisy seed.

The goal is to give a starters guide for noobs wanting to learn how to connect and setup your own hardware with the software Plugdata.

The Plugdata approach has the capacity to be a bit more user friendly than going the full-on coding method with e.g. Arduino or C++.

These are some of the topics handled on this site:

Setting up Plugdata
* What is Pure Data, what is Plugdata
* Installation
* Plugdata to Daisy

* Basic insight in the handling of signal flow, memory and cpu

Library of examples showing the usage of basis components:
* potentiometer and faders
* momentary pushbutton = switches
* Toggle /switch

More 'advanced' parts:
* LED
* Midi
* Sensors
* CV
* Screens
